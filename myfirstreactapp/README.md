# React Contact Component

## Overview

This project contains a simple React component that displays a contact information page. The component features a password-protected interface. When the correct password is entered, some contact information is displayed; otherwise, a password prompt is shown.

## Component Details

### `Contact` Component

- **Functionality**:
  - Renders a password form if the user is not authorized.
  - Renders contact information if the user enters the correct password.
- **Password**:

  - The password required to access the contact information is `"dontTryThis"`.

- **Features**:
  - **Password Input**: Users are prompted to enter a password.
  - **Form Submission**: On form submission, the password is checked against a predefined value.
  - **Conditional Rendering**: Depending on whether the correct password is entered, either a password prompt or contact information is displayed.

### Code Breakdown

- **State Management**:

  - Uses `useState` to manage the `authorized` state, which determines if the user has entered the correct password.

- **Event Handling**:

  - `handleSubmit` function processes the form submission, checks the entered password, and updates the `authorized` state accordingly.

- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - Renders either a login form or contact information based on the `authorized` state.
